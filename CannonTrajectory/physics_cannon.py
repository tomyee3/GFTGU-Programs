State vector:
    x  — horizontal position
    h  — vertical position (height)
    u  — horizontal velocity
    v  — vertical velocity

The physics:
    Horizontal motion has no acceleration.
    Vertical motion has constant downward acceleration g.

    Compute time derivatives for projectile motion.

    Equivalent to the Java logic:
        dx/dt = u
        dh/dt = v

        dv/dt = -g

    Basic Euler step.
    This matches the first numerical method introduced in
    Investigation 1.3 of Gravity From the Ground Up.

def improved_euler_step(state, dt):

    Improved Euler (Heun’s method).

    This mirrors Schutz’s Java implementation:
        - Compute w = v - g*dt
        - Use average vertical speed (v + w)/2 for height update
        - Use predictor–corrector logic for full state update

    In Python, we implement this using the standard Heun method,
    which is mathematically identical to Schutz’s step.
